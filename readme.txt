== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: With which shopping plugin is Murphsy.com Product Feed Silver usable? = 
A: We have developed the plugin for use with Woocommerce. We have tested it only on Woocommerce. 

= Q: Will this work with other shopping plugins? =
A: Probably not. 

= Q: My feed isn't updating according to the interval, what's wrong? = 
A: Product Feed Silver uses WP_cron to schedule the update of your product feed. WP_cron only triggers if someone visits your website. So if you aren't receiving enough visitors the product feed might not update when expected.
